			<h3><u>Languages & I</u></h3>
			<p>
			Since I was young, I like to explore our world through books. For example, by reading, I learned different cultures in various countries as well as the way this society works. In addition, by reading magazines concerning science and biology, I learn the essence of the world and the universe. Besides, I am fasinated by music and arts. In my high school, besides visiting museums and galleries, I also learned how to play the guitar. When speaking of languages, apart from English, I also learned Japanese. The reason why I started to acquire Japanese is because of the impact of animation and entertaining TV show, which makes me want to dig into the charm of Japanese literature. After entering the university, I not only gain the certificate of Japanese ability (N2), but also participate in a language exchange program. Through these activities, besides being able to talk to foreigners, I hope one day I can find what I trully want to do in the future. (more)
