			Hi, I’m Cheng-En, Yeh, a student from National Tsing-Hua University (Taiwan, ROC). I am majoring in foreign language and literature. Besides learning literature and linguistics, I also minor in Economics, acquiring advanced knowledge concerning economics and Finance. Furthermore, as a second foreign language, I am learning Japanese as well.<br/>

				<p>My chance to acquire foreign languages began at the English cram school that I had gone to every weekend when I was in primary school. At the very beginning, I was reluctant to go there, but soon I found the fascination of learning English. For example, English enables me to not only communicate with people worldwide but also brought me a deeper understanding of western cultures.<br/></p><p> After I entered the university, I learned Japanese as well. The reason why I am interested in Japanese is that since I was young, I have been a lover of watching Japanese animation and entertainment TV shows. To enhance my communication abilities, I am also participating in the language exchange program at Tokyo University with Foreign Studies.</p>

				<p>As a resident who has lived in Hsinchu for 22 years, my hobbies are reading, playing basketball, and traveling. In my childhood, I was a kid who liked to explore the world. As a result, books became my best friends, bringing me to various countries. My favorite type of book is fantasy novels, like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. These novels accompanied me to those worlds with unique and fantastic views from my childhood.<br/></p>

				<p>As for basketball, it is the sport that I have played since childhood. My opportunity to contact this sport is the games from NBA on TV. Since then, when I am free, I always practice playing basketball in the park. In my junior high school, besides participating in the school team, to improve my abilities, I also started to play 3 vs. 3 with others.<br/></p>

				<p>I, who spent twelve years studying in Hsinchu City, eventually chose a university that is near my high school. When seeing my younger brother and friends studying in other areas and having fun there, I sometimes want to live outside to learn how to live independently and explore food in an unfamiliar area. At this time, travel becomes my consolation. In my leisure time, I would go to Taipei or Taichung to visit my friends. Before the pandemic era, I also traveled to China and Japan. These experiences not only broaden my horizons but also help me learn how to be independent. Maybe someday, I will meet you somewhere in the world. If you are free, you are always welcome to share your own stories with me.
