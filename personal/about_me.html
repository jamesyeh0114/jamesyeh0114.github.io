			<h1>關於我</h1>
			<section>
			<p>您好，我是葉承恩，目前就讀於清華大學外國語文學系、輔修經濟系。
			身為一個在新竹居住長達22年的學生，我的興趣是閱讀、打籃球與看動畫等等。
			從小開始，我是一個喜歡探索世界的小孩。透過書本，除了瞭解各地的風俗民情以外，也慢慢地理解了這個社會的運作模式。除此之外，我也非常喜歡閱讀科學、生物等相關的雜誌等等。在認識科學的同時，我也能夠認識這個世界。在探索這個世界的同時，我也對音樂、藝術產生了興趣。在國高中，除了參觀美術館與博物館以外，也自學了吉他。
			在有關語言方面，除了英文以外，我也學了日文。學習日文的契機是由於從小開始看動畫與日本綜藝節目，因此便對其文化感到了興趣。在大學時，除了成功考取日文檢定N2以外，我也參加了來自東京外國語大學的語言交換。希望能透過這些活動，除了與外國人交流以外，也能找到自己未來想做的事。</p>

			<h1>About me</h1>
			<section>
			<p>
			Hi, I'm James (or you can call me James), a student majoring in Foreign Language and Literature, minoring in Economics in National Tsing-Hua University.
			As a student who have lived in Hsinchu City for more than 22 years, my interests are reading books, playing basketball, watching animation and so on.
			Since I was young, I like to explore our world through books. For example, by reading, I learned different cultures in various countries as well as the way this society works. In addition, by reading magazines concerning science and biology, I learn the essence of the world and the universe. Besides, I am fasinated by music and arts. In my high school, besides visiting museums and galleries, I also learned how to play the guitar. When speaking of languages, apart from English, I also learned Japanese. The reason why I started to acquire Japanese is because of the impact of animation and entertaining TV show, which makes me want to dig into the charm of Japanese literature. After entering the university, I not only gain the certificate of Japanese ability (N2), but also participate in a language exchange program. Through these activities, besides being able to talk to foreigners, I hope one day I can find what I trully want to do in the future.
