			Have you ever played this board game before? What is your recommended board games? These are the questions that often be asked among board game lovers. To me, board games have been friends since my childhood. Besides books, reading and understanding the rules of games are also beneficial to my abilities of understanding words and logical thinking. </p>
			<p>Meanwhile, board games are common tools in young generations’ social occasions as well. For example, on one hand, when visiting friends that haven’t seen for a long time, board games can make the atmosphere more actively. On the other hand, when meeting with strangers, board games also can help each other get familiar.

			<h2><span>What is Board Game？</span></h2>

			The phrase “board games” refers to games without any electronic devices. In general speaking, poker cards, chess and Monopoly are board games. Apart from these kinds of games, board games can be divided into two categories. That is, “Eurogame” and “Ameritrash”.

			<p>
			The feature of <span>“Eurogame”</span> is that <span>its rule is easy to understand</span>, which is suitable for beginners. In comparison with other board games, its content is similar, including tiny wood blocks, cards and plates. As a result, its<span> price is affordable</span>. Its type is mostly categorized as<span> family games</span>. One of the representative games is <span>“Carcassonne”</span>. 
			</p>
			<p>				
			In Carcassonne, the players act as lords, dispatching their secondaries to broaden their territory. On the basis of different areas occupied, the secondaries will transform into different characters (knights, bandits, farmers and monks). As a player who has played other board games, it took me ten minutes to comprehend the rules. Afterward, I taught my cousin, who studied in primary school. She understood them so quickly that we then played Carcassonne immediately. To sum up, the experience implies that the simplicity of “Eurogame” might benefit <span>the relationship between adults and children</span>.

			相反地，<span>「美式桌遊」</span>的規則較為<spam>複雜</spam>。許多遊戲的說明書都相當地厚。換句話說，<span>理解遊戲的規則與遊玩較花時間</span>。它的<span>內容物較為精美</span>，除了遊戲版圖、卡片以外，也有代表遊戲角色的模型。但<span>售價較高</span>。在遊戲的世界裡，玩家扮演裡面的角色，進行一場<span>有劇情、冒險</span>的旅程。代表的遊戲有，<span>「山中小屋」與「瘋狂詭宅」</span>等等。我最喜歡的美式桌遊是<span>「復仇女神號」</span>。在遊戲裡，玩家在一艘名為「復仇女神號」的太空船裡，扮演不同職業（像是醫師、工程師）。除了與來自宇宙的怪物對抗以外，玩家裡也有不同陣營。有些人的勝利目標是返回宇宙，相反地有些人是阻止返回、並且摧毀太空船。<span>如何在來自外部的威脅與個人目標之間達成平衡</span>是這個遊戲最有挑戰性的地方。但在規則方面，我花不少時間理解。在遊玩的時間上，也需要兩、三個小時。因此<span>較適合成年人</span>。

			<h2><b>The Digital Version of Board Games</b></h2>

				<p>
					Along with the advance of technology, many companies have rolled out <span> the digital version of board games,</span> allowing players to <span> buy them at lower prices. </span> In my opinion, it has several advantages. First of all, through the game platform, everyone can <span> get access to players around the world anywhere and anytime. </span>Moreover, there are events in the games that give players motivation to win the reward by keeping playing on the game.</p><p> For instance, last year, a card game called “Yu-Gi-Oh” released its electronic platform “Master Duel”. Gamers can spend no money utilizing every function in the game. It is especially friendly to students like me since in reality, the decks are hardly affordable, at approximately NT$ 3000 per deck. Furthermore, in reality, finding a card partner is difficult, not to mention I, who is afraid of strangers. Yet, on the game platform, I cannot only play with my friends but also with players around the world. <span> If you are interested in the board game but having trouble with money or finding someone you can play with, please try these “digital board games”. </span>
