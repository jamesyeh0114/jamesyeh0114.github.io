They flew toward the roads and shell craters, closer and closer to the front line where Russian and Ukrainian troops were killing one another with gins, <span class="vocab">grenades<span><b>"grenade"</b> - a small bomb thrown by hand or shot from a gun. </span></span> and rockets. <span class="joint">►</span> And then they flew home.
