					<p>BOHDANIVKA,Ukraine -- By the time the weather warmed after a cold spring, the fieldof sunflowers where for decades Petro Fedorovych's bees would gather nectar to make their amber honey were mostly unplanted and abandoned.<br/>
						The war had crept across the eastern Ukrainian steppe after Russia's invasion in February. The city of Sievierodonetsk fell, then Lysychansk. The front lines moved until the incessant thuds and bangs of artillery arrived around the beekeeper's small village, Bohdanivka, with the heat.<br/>
						But still his bees left their hives just as they had every summer. Petro Fedorovych, 71, watched them fly beyond their familiar fields. They flew toward the roads and shell craters, closer and closer to the front line where Russian and Ukrainian troops were killing one another with gins, grenades and rockets.<br/>
						And then they flew home.

				<h3>[Sec, #2]<h3>
					<p>Millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes since the war began more than six months ago. But many have stayed, sheltering in basements and elsewhere, resolute in their decision to brave the onslaught for a litany of reasons: nowhere else to go, no money, disabled family members, pro-Russian sentiments. The list goes on.<br/>
						But Petro Fedorovych's decision to remain at his house with his bees and his wife, Ira, and their goat, Flower, was as simple at it gets: It was their home. It was a world unto itself, where even the destruction slowly encroaching felt more favorable than the unknown in the cities and towns beyond Russian artillery range.<br/>
						"I bulit this house with my hands," he said late last month, his gray hair unkempt and sweat from a morning of beekeeping already forming on his brow. "I will never leave."<br/>
						All wars are terrible, but the war in Ukraine stands out because of its brutal methodology. Artillery can turn villages like Bohdanivka into graveyards almost overnight. If Russian troops want to advance, they will do so slowly, chewing up virtually everything in their path with so much ordnance that uninterrupted moments of silence make a stomach-tightening anxiety a complement to the next horror.

				<h3>[Sec, #3]<h3>
					<p>Bohdanivka, with a population of around 150 people, lies between where Russian troops are now, and where they want to go: the rest of the Donbas, a region of rolling fields, mining towards and the hundreds of thoudsands of Petro Fedorovych's bees.<br/>
					To Petro Fedorovych, who served in the Soviet Army at the height of the Cold War, Russia's invasion is neither an invasion nor a war; it is just "it." The war did not begin, "it began," he said.<br/>
					"They are abusing the people, and that's it," he said, not naming Ukraine or Russia. The sharp crack of outgoing artillery fire sounded nearby.<br/>
					After he left the military, he moved to Bohdanivka in 1972, where he worked long hours as a veterinarian on a collective dairy farm. Ira was a nurse in the nearby city of what was then called Artemivsk, now Bakhmut. They met soon after, though it took some time for him to muster up the courage to talk to her.

					They married on June 19, 1976, and had two daughters and a son. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Petro Fedorovych built his family a two-story brick house on Bohdanivka's outshirts. They were surrounded by tranquil fields and near a reservoir where the Ukrainian Army has now placed troops and vehicles.<br/>
					For his bees, he built blue-painted wooden hives that litter his backyard like beacons among the tall grass, their inhabitants furiously commuting among the chickens, a dilapidated white Volga sedan and clusters of phacelia, viper's bugloss and mustard plants. The iron fence that faces the street was once lined with roses, Ira said, but this season they are gone.<br/>
					Bees have been a part of Petro Fedorovych's life since
