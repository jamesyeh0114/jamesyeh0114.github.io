			<h1>Structure Analysis</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>In the opening paragraph [<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], the last two sentences that as highlighted in the following quotes would be considered as the thesis statement for two reasons. First and foremost, they contains words like <q>troop", "shell craters</q>, indicating that bees' familiar fields had become battlefield for Russian and Ukrainian, which will be mentioned throughout the essay. Furthermore, the sentence <q> And then they flew home</q> implies that the beekeeper's homeland was in danger, which leaves a foreshadowing for the beekeeper's personal stories in the following paragraphs.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>
					BOHDANIVKA,Ukraine -- By the time the weather warmed after a cold spring, the fieldof sunflowers where for decades Petro Fedorovych's bees would gather <span class="vocab">nectar<span><b>"nectar"</b> - a sweet liquid produced by flowers and collected by bees and other insects. </span></span> to make their amber honey were mostly unplanted and abandoned. <span class="joint">►</span> The war had crept across the eastern Ukrainian steppe after Russia's invasion in February. The city of Sievierodonetsk fell, then Lysychansk. The front lines moved until the incessant thuds and bangs of artillery arrived around the beekeeper's small village, Bohdanivka, with the heat. <span class="joint">►</span> But still his bees left their hives just as they had every summer. Petro Fedorovych, 71, watched them fly beyond their familiar fields. <span style=" background-color: #80cdc1;">They flew toward the roads and shell craters, closer and closer to the front line where Russian and Ukrainian troops were killing one another with gins, <span class="vocab">grenades<span><b>"grenade"</b> - a small bomb thrown by hand or shot from a gun. </span></span> and rockets. <span class="joint">►</span> And then they flew home.</span>

				<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
				<u1> <!-- Unordered List 用點去標示 -->
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec2">Sec. #2</a>] - Petro Fedorovych's and other Ukrainians' decision when the war began.</b>
						<p>At the beginning of this section, it indicates that owing to the war, some people are forced to leave their hometown. Yet, without sufficient resources to survive and nowhere to go, other people chose to stay. <q>But many have stayed, sheltering in basements and elsewhere, resolute in their decision to brave the onslaught for a litany of reasons: nowhere else to go, no money, disabled family members, pro-Russian sentiments.</q> The rest of the passage further elaborate on Petro Fedorovych's decision after the war tookplace, who determined to stay with his house and wife. The reason is obvious in the key sentence: <q>It was a world unto itself, where even the destruction slowly encroaching felt more favorable than the unknown in the cities and towns beyond Russian artillery range.</q> From his words: <q>I bulit this house with my hands, I will never leave</q>, which also implies his emotion toward his homeland.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec3">Sec. #3</a>] - & Current situations of Bohdanivka under the war  </b>

						<p>Several specific phrases show the main idea of this paragraph. For instance, the phrases <q>brutal methodology</q>, <q>turn villages like Bohdanivka into graveyards almost overnight</q> and <q>chewing up virtually everything in their path</q> shows that the current situation in Ukraine was in danger. Even Bohdanivka, a small village in Ukraine, cannot prevent suffering from such a serious damage. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec4">Sec. #4</a>] - The meaning of war to Petro Fedorovych & His life after leaving the military.</b>

						<p>The key phrase <q>Russia's invasion is neither an invasion nor a war; it is just "it." The war did not begin, "it began"</q> can best summarize Petro Fedorovych's viewpoint in the first paragraph. Moreover, the phrase is consistent with the last section, which also depicts the scene of war.</p>
						<p>
						On the other hand, the second part of this paragraph continues Petro Fedorovych's life after serving in the Soviet Army, including how he met his wife, building his own house in tranquility. Yet, in the last sentence<q>They were surrounded by tranquil fields and near a reservoir where the Ukrainian Army has now placed troops and vehicles.</q>, it is consistent with [<a href="example.html#sec3">Sec. #3</a>] and the following paragraphs.

					</li>
					<li>

As a result, bees are more easily getting irritated. <q>"The bees became different," he said, referring to the shelling. "Ira won't go in the garden, they won't give her a minutes rest. It's because of the noise."</q> Moreover, at the beginning of the paragraph, it indicates that the bees' population were decreasing and hardly recovered.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec7">Sec. #7</a>] - An unexpected gain of honey in this season.</b>
						<p>At the beginning of this section, Petro Fedorovych indicated that he originally did not anticipate in the return of honey for two reasons.

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>In the last section of the entire essay (see <a href="example.html#sec8">Sec. #8</a>), it implies Petro Fedorovych's determination to being a beekeeper. In reality, most of his grandkids showed no interest of keeping bees and had already left their hometown. In contrast, Petro Fedorovych showed no approval in leaving there. To him, bees, a way to remember his father, had already been regarded as his own son. After all, last but not least, <span style= "background-color: #80cdc1;">no matter how perilous the situations were, Petro Fedorovych would endeavor himself to beekeeping and taking care of his beloved sons, the frontline bees, instead of abandoning them.</span></p>
				
				<p class="quote"><q>Sunflower honey was still his favorite after decades of beekeeping. But now, in his twilight, there was no one to take up his life's work and to take care of the bees that he would rather die for than abandon. <span class="joint">►</span> "Of course, Dad dreams that someone in the family will inherit this trade, but so far the grandkids are growing up" and showing little interest, said Lilia, the family's youngest daughter, sitting in a restaurant hundreds of miles away in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.</q></p>
				 <p class="quote"><q>
				 	Lilia has watched in fear as the war comes closer to her parents' home. A nurse like her mother, Lilia sells honey her father mails to the neighbors; a pound costs roughly a dollar. Two years ago, Lilia, 45, bought her father a new beekeeper suit, decorated with newspaper front pages, off the Internet. <span class="joint">►</span> Lilia has tried again and again to get her parents to leave Bohdanivka, but to no avail. <span class="joint">►</span> "It especially hurts when our friends and acquaintances take their parents away," she said."But they are taking them out. And me, however I approach this topic, they won't agree."<span class="joint">►</span>"Dad won't leave behind his children," she added, speaking of the bees. His other children had left home long ago.
