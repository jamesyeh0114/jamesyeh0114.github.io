				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>In the opening paragraph [<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], the last two sentences that as highlighted in the following quotes would be considered as the thesis statement for two reasons. First and foremost, they contains words like <q>troop", "shell craters</q>, indicating that bees' familiar fields had become battlefield for Russian and Ukrainian, which will be mentioned throughout the essay. Furthermore, the sentence <q> And then they flew home</q> implies that the beekeeper's homeland was in danger, which leaves a foreshadowing for the beekeeper's personal stories in the following paragraphs.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>
					BOHDANIVKA,Ukraine -- By the time the weather warmed after a cold spring, the fieldof sunflowers where for decades Petro Fedorovych's bees would gather <span class="vocab">nectar<span><b>"nectar"</b> - a sweet liquid produced by flowers and collected by bees and other insects. </span></span> to make their amber honey were mostly unplanted and abandoned. <span class="joint">►</span> The war had crept across the eastern Ukrainian steppe after Russia's invasion in February. The city of Sievierodonetsk fell, then Lysychansk. The front lines moved until the incessant thuds and bangs of artillery arrived around the beekeeper's small village, Bohdanivka, with the heat. <span class="joint">►</span> But still his bees left their hives just as they had every summer. Petro Fedorovych, 71, watched them fly beyond their familiar fields. <span style=" background-color: #80cdc1;">They flew toward the roads and shell craters, closer and closer to the front line where Russian and Ukrainian troops were killing one another with gins, <span class="vocab">grenades<span><b>"grenade"</b> - a small bomb thrown by hand or shot from a gun. </span></span> and rockets. <span class="joint">►</span> And then they flew home.</span>

					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec2">Sec. #2</a>] - Petro Fedorovych's and other Ukrainians' decision when the war began.</b>
						<p>At the beginning of this section, it indicates that owing to the war, some people are forced to leave their hometown. Yet, without sufficient resources to survive and nowhere to go, other people chose to stay. <q>But many have stayed, sheltering in basements and elsewhere, resolute in their decision to brave the onslaught for a litany of reasons: nowhere else to go, no money, disabled family members, pro-Russian sentiments.</q> The rest of the passage further elaborate on Petro Fedorovych's decision after the war tookplace, who determined to stay with his house and wife. The reason is obvious in the key sentence: <q>It was a world unto itself, where even the destruction slowly encroaching felt more favorable than the unknown in the cities and towns beyond Russian artillery range.</q> From his words: <q>I bulit this house with my hands, I will never leave</q>, which also implies his emotion toward his homeland.</p>
